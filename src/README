Started this project on Nov. 25 and finished on Nov. 30.
I did not consult anyone.
I did consult online resources regarding different ways to access data in a file. 
I really liked this assignment because it forced me to actually learn the mechanics of opening and reading a file.
Usually this part is done for us (like on exams). The actually coding that was necessary wasn't extremely difficult,
just lengthy as the data had to be manipulated in multiple ways.
