I checked the code written in recommender by hand. For instance, I found the average ratings of the restaurants and
similarity scores for those raters by doing simple calculation. I debugged code by writing code little by little and 
seeing what its result was. Based on those results and comparing them to what I expected them to be, I knew whether or not
to change what I had.

   Will/Samantha & Will/Tracy have positive sim. scores and all rank
   ABP positively, so it makes sense that this score would be high   

n = 3 and person = Samantha:

																		George and Samantha have neg. sim score
																		and George ranked Great Hall badly, so
																		it is likely that Samantha will like GH	
																		
('WaDuke', -207)- Samantha's highest sim score was with Tracy, and they both rated WaDuke badly. Coupled with George's 
negative sim score and positive ranking of WaDuke, WaDuke will not be likely to be highly recommended to Samantha.
